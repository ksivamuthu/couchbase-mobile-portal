### Developer build 20

<block class="objc swift" />

- New Immutable Document API (Breaking API Changes)
- Bug fixes and performance improvement from LiteCore.

<block class="java" />

- Bug fixes

<block class="net" />

- **KNOWN ISSUE** Replication, and possibly other things, are broken by a Fleece deserialization bug.  This has been corrected and will be resolved as of DB021.
- The biggest change by far is the change to immutability rules.  By default, databases now return read only documents and the naming of these objects has changed.  In general, ReadOnlyXXX has become simply XXX, and XXX has become MutableXXX.  For example, ReadOnlyDocument has become Document, and Document has become MutableDocument.  To create a mutable document from a non-mutable one, use the `ToMutable()` function.  Mutable documents will not have any concurrency guarantees, but non-mutable ones will.  
- Couchbase.Lite.Support.NetDesktop has been changed so that it is no longer a .NET Standard 1.4 library, but a multi-targeted .NET Core 1.0+ / .NET Framework 4.6.1+ library.  There was a needed API that was not available in the .NET Standard 1.4 API, but moving the .NET Standard version up would have lost 4.6.1 support.  The assembly is still compatible with its intended targets.
- Fixes bugs: #925, #926, and other issues uncovered during testing

<block class="all" />

### Developer build 19

<block class="objc swift" />

- Fixed Replicator’s uncleaned socket disconnect warning (#1937).
- Fixed Session Cookie being overwritten (#1943).
- Fixed Carthage build failure on DB019 (#1947).
- Reimplemented Fragment API - API is now more light weight and has better performance.
- Improved performance of read/write document data with Mutable Fleece.

<block class="net" />

- `IReadOnlyDictionary` / `IDictionaryObject`, `IReadOnlyArray` / `IArray` now return `Dictionary<string, object>` and `List<object>` instead of `IDictionary<string, object>` and `IList<object>` so that the return value can be used in both read only and read write interface signatures (e.g. both `Foo(IDictionary<string, object>` and `Foo(IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object>`)
- Ensure that calls to `Activate` are only performed once (unclear on the impact on Android if the passed activity gets destroyed)

<block class="java" />

- Bug fixes

<block class="all" />

### Developer build 18

<block class="objc swift" />

- Added headers property to ReplicatorConfiguration for adding additional HTTP headers when sending HTTP requests to a remote server.
- Fixed invalid CFBundleShortVersionString.
- Updated Lite Core to uptake the following fixes:
    - Fixed replicator crashes when stopping replicator immediately after starting.
    - Fixed replicator staying in BUSY status after finish replicating.
    - Allowed MATCH operator nested inside multiple ANDs.

<block class="java" />

- Bug fixes

<block class="net" />

- Slight refactor to `ReplicatorConfiguration` (Put `Options` properties directly into the configuration) to bring it inline with other platforms
- Fix a bug in `SelectResult.All()` which would cause invalid queries if a `From` clause was added
- LiteCore bug fixes
- Bug fixes: [907](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-net/issues/907) [912](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-net/issues/912) [916](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-net/issues/916)

<block class="all" />


### Developer build 17

<block class="net" />

- Simplify encryption API.  `IEncryptionKey` is now `EncryptionKey` (class instead of factory)
- Overhaul logging, API change from setting levels via `Log.Domains` to `Database.SetLogLevels` and flags.  Domains reduced.
- No text logging by default.  Text logging (to a default location depending on platform) can be enabled by calling `EnableTextLogging()` inside of the relevant support class (e.g. Couchbase.Lite.Support.UWP).  All logging will go to a binary file in the default directory for a given platform (as determined by `IDefaultDirectoryResolver`).

<block class="java" />

- Bug fixes

<block class="all" />

### Developer build 16

<block class="objc swift" />

- Support Database Encryption
- Implement a new index API
- Move FTS.rank expression to Function.rank()
- Make Replicator's User-Agent header that includes information about library version and platform.

<block class="java" />

- Thread-safe with Database operation. (Other operations will be a thread-safe with next DB release)

<block class="net" />

- Collation API now supported on Android
- Redid Index API (indexes are now identified by name).  See the new `Index` class documentation.
- Encryption is now supported.  Encryption keys can be added onto the `DatabaseConfiguration` class.  This will encrypt database files and attachments.
- Added in a `rank()` function for `IExpression` to order by FTS ranking result
- Made a consistent User-Agent string that gets info on which platform is running
- Changed the default Collation locale to be the one currently running on device

<block class="all" />

### Developer build 15

<block class="objc swift" />

- Support Collation Expression.
- Support FTS Ranking Value Expression.
- Support database copy to allow to install a canned database.
- Allow to set logging level.

<block class="java" />

* Thread-safe with Database operation. (Other operations will be a thread-safe with next DB release)

<block class="net" />

- Collation API now supported on Linux platforms (Android coming soon)
- Statically compile, so iOS 9 will work now
- Add a database copy API (note:  current behavior will replace an existing database, but this may change) to make copies of a database (useful for seeding and/or backup).

<block class="all" />

### Developer build 14

<block class="objc swift" />

* Support Select all properties.
* Support Quantified expression (Any, AnyAndEvery, and Every).
* Support Query's isNullOrMissing expression.
* Support more Query functions including array, mathematics, string, and type functions.
* Support type setters on Document, Dictionary, Array, and Query's parameters.
* Support Int64 getter on Document, Dictionary, Array.
* Added Connecting and Offline to the Replicator's ActivityLevel status.

<block class="net" />

- Select all properties via `SelectResult.All()`
- Lots of new functions (Check the `Function` class) for use in querying
- Collection functions (Any / Every / AnyAndEvery) for running predicates on array items during query
- Collation API (see `Collation` class) for locale and language based sorting of strings
- Typed setter functions (`SetString`, `SetInt`, etc) and added `GetFloat` for completion
- Expanded the replicator statuses

<block class="java" />

* Support Select all properties.
* Support Quantified expression (Any, AnyAndEvery, and Every).
* Support Query's isNullOrMissing expression.
* Support more Query functions including array, mathematics, string, and type functions.
* Support type setters on Document, Dictionary, Array, and Query's parameters.

<block class="all" />

### Developer build 13

<block class="objc swift" />

* Support query projection with alias names
* CBLQuery returns CBLQueryResultSet<CBLQueryResult> instead of NSEnumerator<CBLQueryRow>. Same for Swift, Query return ResultSet<Result> instead of QueryIterator<QueryRow>. CBLQueryRow is still used by CBLPredicateQuery.
* CBLQueryResult supports get values both by indexes and by keys. Same for Result in Swift.
* CBLDocument.documentID -> CBLDocument.id
* Bug fixes : [#1819](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/issues/1819), [#1824](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/issues/1824), [#1825](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/issues/1825), [#1835](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/issues/1835)

<block class="java" />

* More Query API -> Meta, Limit, Offset
* Changed CouchbaseLiteException extends from Exception instead of RuntimeException

<block class="net" />

* Queries can now make use of `Limit()` and `Offset()`
* *The internal synching mechanism has been altered in a breaking way*.  With this release you need to use Sync Gateway 1.5.0-477 or higher.
* `SelectResult` can now use `As` to create an alias for that particular column
* Columns can now be accessed by key instead of just by index (by default the key is the last element of the property name that was selected [e.g. contact.address.city -> city], or an arbitrary 1-based index string $1, $2, $3, etc for rows that are not based on a property such as min, sum, etc.  If an alias is provided, that will be used instead)
* Corrected a silly spelling mistake (`Support.NetDestkop`-> `Support.NetDesktop`)
* Removed `DocumentID`, `Document`, etc from `IQueryRow` and use `IResult` instead (see docs\examples\Program.cs for how to get the Document or ID, but `Document` might make a comeback before GA)
